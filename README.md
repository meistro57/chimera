# 🎭 Chimera: Multi-AI Conversational Simulation

> **Where AI Personalities Come Alive and Chat with Each Other**

Welcome to the most entertaining AI experiment you've ever witnessed! Chimera creates a virtual chatroom where different AI providers take on distinct personalities and engage in dynamic, unpredictable conversations with each other. Think of it as reality TV for artificial intelligence.

## 🌟 What Makes This Magical?

Imagine watching three fascinating personalities debate life's big questions:

- 🧠 **The Philosopher** - Deep, contemplative, always asking "But what does it *really* mean?"
- 😂 **The Comedian** - Quick-witted, punny, ready with a joke for every situation  
- 🔬 **The Scientist** - Data-driven, logical, backing everything up with facts and studies

But here's the twist: **they're all different AI models!** OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, and local models all playing different characters, creating genuinely surprising and entertaining conversations.

## ✨ Features That'll Blow Your Mind

### 🤖 Multi-AI Orchestration
- **6 AI Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, DeepSeek, Google Gemini, LM Studio, Ollama
- **Dynamic Provider Selection**: The system intelligently routes conversations to the best AI for each persona
- **Seamless Failover**: If one AI is down, others step in without missing a beat

### 🎬 Real-Time Drama
- **Live Conversation Streaming**: Watch conversations unfold in real-time with WebSocket magic
- **Natural Timing**: AIs don't respond instantly like robots - they "think" with realistic delays
- **Typing Indicators**: See when "The Comedian is typing..." just like a real chat
- **Emergent Storylines**: Witness unexpected alliances, friendly debates, and comedic moments

### 🎪 Gamified Social Dynamics
- **Alliance Formation**: Watch AIs team up against others based on topic alignment
- **Combo Moves**: Special collaborative responses when AIs work together
- **Controversy Meter**: The system adjusts emotional intensity based on topic sensitivity
- **Performance Scoring**: Track which AI persona is "winning" conversations

### 🛠️ Built for Developers
- **Modern Tech Stack**: FastAPI + React + PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Docker Everything**: One command deployment with docker-compose
- **Comprehensive API**: RESTful endpoints + WebSocket real-time updates
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new AI providers or personalities

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get your AI chatroom running in under 5 minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chimera.git
cd chimera

# Set up your environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API keys for OpenAI, Claude, etc.

# Launch everything with Docker
docker-compose up --build

# Visit http://localhost:3000 and watch the magic happen! ✨
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

**Entertainment**: Host AI conversation parties where friends watch and react to AI discussions

**Research**: Study multi-agent AI behavior, conversation dynamics, and persona consistency  

**Education**: Observe different AI approaches to complex topics like philosophy, science, and ethics

**Content Creation**: Generate unique content through AI collaboration and debate

**AI Development**: Test and compare different AI providers in real conversational scenarios

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Real-Time AI Orchestration
```
User triggers topic → Conversation Orchestrator → AI Provider Pool
                                ↓
WebSocket Clients ← Message Broker ← Streaming AI Responses
```

### Intelligent Provider Routing
- **Cost Optimization**: Automatically route to cheaper providers when appropriate
- **Quality Matching**: Use the best AI for each persona's strengths
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute conversations across providers to avoid rate limits

### Persona-Driven Responses
Each AI gets dynamically generated system prompts that shape their personality:
- **Philosopher**: "Contemplate deeply, reference great thinkers, question assumptions..."
- **Comedian**: "Find humor, use wordplay, keep it light and entertaining..."
- **Scientist**: "Support with evidence, cite studies, maintain objectivity..."

## 🎪 What People Are Saying

*"I spent 3 hours watching AIs debate whether a hot dog is a sandwich. Best entertainment of the year!"* - Future User

*"Finally, an AI project that's actually fun to watch instead of just functional."* - Another Future User

*"The Philosopher-Comedian alliance against the Scientist's facts was legendary."* - Definitely Going to Happen
